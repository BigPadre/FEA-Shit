#takes list of nodes from iso drawing, converts lengths and angle to global geometry parameter list (lengths and angles)

#func that selects nodes from geometry corners in iso drawings numbered by selection order and iso lengths

#need horz line ref datum for iso angle calcs 

#30 deg from horz datum to node-node line: out of plane straight line right face
#150 deg from horz dat: out of plane left face
#90 deg: vert edge
#implicit forward tilt of z axis: also 30 deg?
#for acute angles between nodes in iso view, add 30 to get global corner angle
#for obtuse angles between nodes, subtract 30 for global
#collect u,v coords from iso view for assoicated nodea
#convert to net rectangular length for iso lengths 
#use z axis tilt and horz datum angle to get transformed iso lengths 
#establish proportion factors based on trans iso lengths and known dims 
#convert trans iso lengths
